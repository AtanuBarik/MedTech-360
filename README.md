# MedTech 360

MedTech 360 is an Evalueserve-themed, static interactive prototype for MedTech Competitive Intelligence (CI) and Primary Market Research (PMR). It is designed to work directly in a browser and can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## User journey

1. **Login** – prototype enterprise SSO plus username/password access.
2. **Workspace setup** – the user selects both a MedTech domain and a role (Hub Owner, Contributor, Viewer).
3. **Interactive platform** – the **Executive Hub** is the landing page, followed by expandable CI and PMR segments. Clicking a segment reveals its sub-segments; every sub-segment opens a dedicated page.
4. **Log out** – available in the dashboard top bar and left navigation.

## MedTech domains

- Autoimmunity & Allergy
- Diabetes & Blood Glucose Monitoring
- Ophthalmology & Eye Health
- Orthopedics & Sports Medicine
- Advanced Wound Management
- Clinical Laboratory Services

## Executive Hub

The Executive Hub changes by selected domain and contains:

- Industry overview and category context
- Factual research datapoints with external source links
- Priority market dynamics
- Key-player watchlist
- Illustrative industry-momentum visualization
- Opportunity areas and cross-workstream business questions
- Links into CI and PMR capability pages

## Executive Hub

The Executive Hub is the landing page for each selected domain. It contains the industry overview, sourced market context, market dynamics, key players, competitive signals, and the full **Market Landscape & Sizing** module including its research/data architecture, business questions, outputs, analytical cuts, category structure, and domain-specific intelligence lens.

## Competitive Intelligence sub-segments

Company Profiles; News & Alerts; Product & Portfolio Benchmarking; M&A Partnerships & Investment; Social & Digital Media; Strategy & Market Positioning; Conference & KOL Intelligence.

## Primary Market Research sub-segments

Voice of Customer Study; Expert & KOL Interview Analysis; Concept & Product Testing; Quantitative Survey Analysis; Pricing & Willingness-to-Pay.

## Interactive filters

The dashboard now includes persistent filters for **company**, **theme**, and **dataset layer**. Dataset layers include all evidence, public market data, competitive signals, PMR blueprint, and illustrative demo views. Filters persist as the user navigates between Executive Hub, CI, and PMR pages within the selected domain.

## Data note

Factual KPI cards and research statements are tied to external sources listed in the frontend. Trend charts, opportunity indices, competitor watch-intensity scores, and similar dashboard indices are deliberately labeled **illustrative** and are used only to demonstrate the visual and analytical experience. They should be replaced with approved client/project data in production.

## Prototype credentials

- Email: `demo@evalueserve.com`
- Password: `MedTech360`

## GitHub Pages

The repository is published from the `gh-pages` branch. The expected URL is:

`https://atanubarik.github.io/MedTech-360/`

If GitHub Pages needs to be configured manually, open **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select **gh-pages**, choose **/(root)**, and save.

## Production hardening

For client deployment, replace simulated authentication with enterprise SSO (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID / Okta), enforce server-side RBAC, move data and GenAI functions behind governed APIs, add source-level permissions and audit logs, and connect approved PMR/CI repositories and live data feeds.


## Executive Hub industry dashboard

Each of the six domain landing pages now includes:
- source-backed burden / infrastructure facts;
- a clearly labeled illustrative 2022–2028 market model with YoY growth;
- regional opportunity map;
- segment-mix visualization;
- key-player capability matrix and placeholder share visualization;
- growth drivers and constraints;
- trends and source-linked developments;
- device / instrument / service ecosystem flow;
- opportunity scanner with CI watchpoints and PMR questions;
- explicit data labels separating public-source context, illustrative market models, placeholder share estimates, and directional interpretation.

The detailed content is stored in `data-executive.js`.


### Executive Hub interaction update

The landing page now uses five compact interactive tabs: **Overview**, **Market & Regions**, **Competition**, **Ecosystem & Drivers**, and **Strategy & Opportunities**. The former Company / Theme / Dataset dropdown filters and filter ribbon were removed from the top navigation. The domain selector remains.

The Executive Hub now uses:
- source-backed disease / infrastructure context;
- illustrative market-growth charts with strategic interpretation;
- a non-overlapping numbered regional opportunity map;
- a full-width segment-mix view;
- compact multi-step ecosystem cards;
- company logo / website links in competitor views;
- importance-tagged drivers, risks, trends, opportunities, and market-landscape takeaways.


## Company Profiles intelligence dashboard

The **Competitive Intelligence → Company Profiles** module is now a dedicated research experience rather than a generic capability page. It includes domain-specific competitor datasets across all six MedTech domains and interactive filters for **Company**, **Region**, **Portfolio & Services**, and **Focus of Company**.

Each profile includes:
- company overview, headquarters, founding year, ownership / listing, employees and geographic presence;
- official regional website links;
- latest revenue, business-unit revenue, multi-year revenue trend where publicly disclosed, regional / country revenue and financial-result insights;
- product / service portfolio with USP, features, company claims and market positioning;
- regional product and service portfolio;
- transformation timeline, technology stack, competitive USPs and representative devices / tests / services;
- business, product, channel, geographic, digital, R&D and expansion strategy;
- selected M&A / partnership events and strategic initiatives;
- direct links to official company filings, investor materials and product pages.

Private-company financial gaps are explicitly marked as **not publicly disclosed** rather than filled with synthetic values.


### Company Profiles v2

The Company Profiles module now covers **39 company/domain profiles** across the six MedTech domains:
- Autoimmunity & Allergy: 6
- Diabetes & Blood Glucose Monitoring: 6
- Ophthalmology & Eye Health: 6
- Orthopedics & Sports Medicine: 7
- Advanced Wound Management: 7
- Clinical Laboratory Services: 7

The four filters are cascading and dynamic. Selecting **Region**, **Portfolio & Services**, or **Focus of Company** changes the compatible company options and scopes the related regional / product evidence. The separate row of company buttons was removed; only the selected company's logo and profile are shown.

Additional visual analytics include revenue trendlines, annual revenue-growth bars, portfolio-breadth index, regional operating-footprint evidence, strategy-emphasis index, financial KPI tiles, competitive synthesis, risk watchpoints and expanded business-model / market-access content. Analyst indices are explicitly labeled as illustrative demo visualizations.


## Competitive Intelligence workstreams v2

All remaining CI subsections now have dedicated interactive pages:

- **News & Alerts** — local Company, Theme, Time Period and Source filters; curated source-linked news feed; news volume by company; monthly news flow; theme mix; selected-period summary; regulatory, clinical-trial and executive-movement milestones. The theme taxonomy follows Clinical, R&D; Financials; Leadership Changes; Organizational Updates; Other; Partnership, M&A; and Product & Services.
- **Product & Portfolio Benchmarking** — two-company comparison, category / region / benchmark-lens filters, capability bars, product-level table, category overlap and whitespace analysis, and strategy read-through.
- **M&A Partnerships & Investment** — company, deal-type, period and rationale filters; deal counts, structure and rationale visuals; transaction timeline and explicit analyst implication.
- **Social & Digital Media** — company, platform, theme and time filters; directional post-frequency, sentiment, engagement and theme views; public LinkedIn / YouTube / X / Instagram search links; recent public-content signals. Metrics requiring platform APIs are clearly labeled as demo estimates.
- **Strategy & Market Positioning** — company, region and strategy-lens filters; innovation-vs-digital positioning map, multi-company strategy heatmap, narrative strategy cards and risk watchpoints.
- **Conference & KOL Intelligence** — status, theme, year and company-relevance filters; event timing / theme charts, past and upcoming conference cards, venue/date, selected KOL / faculty names and direct conference-site links.

The CI news dataset is curated from company newsrooms, regulatory sources and reputable distribution wires and excludes stock-price / market-share news. It is designed as a decision-support research layer rather than a claim of exhaustive web capture.


### Competitive Intelligence v3

The six CI modules other than Company Profiles have been further enriched with a larger one-year public-source research layer and more decision-oriented analytics.

- **News & Alerts:** five cascading filters including Priority; KPI strip; 12-month news velocity; company volume; theme mix; source-authority mix; priority mix; company-by-theme heatmap; executive signal summary; milestone timeline; and detailed source-linked news cards.
- **Product & Portfolio Benchmarking:** two-company comparison with category, region and benchmark-lens filters; capability and feature heatmaps; quarterly innovation-signal trendlines; regional footprint matrix; portfolio overlap / whitespace; and detailed product evidence tables.
- **M&A Partnerships & Investment:** deal KPIs, quarterly transaction velocity, company activity, structure mix, rationale mix, company-by-rationale matrix, integration-complexity watchlist and transaction-by-transaction implication analysis.
- **Social & Digital Media:** dynamic company / platform / theme / period filters; modeled share of voice, cadence trend, sentiment, platform mix, content-type mix, company-theme matrix, recent source-linked public-content signals and public social search links. Metrics requiring authenticated social APIs remain clearly labeled as demo estimates.
- **Strategy & Market Positioning:** company / region / strategy-lens / evidence-period filters; innovation-vs-digital map, one-year strategy-signal matrix, strategy-emphasis heatmap, strategic archetypes, regional presence and detailed monitoring cards.
- **Conference & KOL Intelligence:** event status / theme / year / company-relevance filters; KPI strip; chronological calendar; theme frequency; faculty/KOL watchlist; event-company relevance matrix; conference-linked launch/evidence tracker and official event links.

The supplementary 2025–2026 research uses company newsrooms, investor releases, regulator information and official conference sites wherever available. Estimated or model-derived metrics are labeled as directional / illustrative.


## Primary Market Research dashboards

The PMR segment has been streamlined to three dedicated analysis modules:
- **Voice of Customer Study**
- **Expert & KOL Interview Analysis**
- **Quantitative Survey Analysis**

The previous **Concept & Product Testing** and **Pricing & Willingness-to-Pay** navigation sections have been removed.

For each of the six MedTech domains, the prototype assumes a **seven-project PMR program** with four qualitative / interview-led projects and three quantitative surveys. The projects intentionally cover diverse methodologies: end-user VOC IDIs, patient / caregiver journey interviews, contextual workflow research, KOL future-state interviews, adoption & access survey, product / service experience benchmark, and decision-driver / readiness survey.

All respondent values, quotations, significance outputs, segments and recommendations are explicitly synthetic demo data. Section-specific filters dynamically recalculate the displayed metrics, matrices and charts.

### Voice of Customer
Includes project / persona / region / care-setting / theme filters, need-state opportunity matrix, theme severity, persona mix, unmet-need and adoption views, persona-by-theme heatmap, domain-specific journey friction, decision drivers, synthetic verbatim evidence and prioritized recommendations.

### Expert & KOL Interview Analysis
Includes project / expert-type / region / theme / consensus filters, theme salience vs consensus, momentum, expert-mix views, expert-by-theme matrix, cross-project recurrence, project synthesis, synthetic KOL evidence and recommendation roadmap.

### Quantitative Survey Analysis
Includes survey / persona / region / care-setting / outcome filters, dynamic analytical base, sample composition, respondent segments, toplines, importance-performance matrix, persona-by-attribute crosstabs, driver strength, mean scores, illustrative significance flags and segment profiles.

The dashboard methodology links to AHRQ patient-experience / narrative guidance and FDA patient-preference information as public methodological context; these sources do not validate the synthetic results.


### PMR v2 enrichment

The Primary Market Research area now has a second-level enrichment layer designed to look like completed / ongoing client studies rather than generic capability examples.

**Primary Market Research landing page**
- Detailed portfolio tracker covering all seven domain-specific demo projects
- Status, method and period filters
- Completed / active counts, total respondent base, methodology mix and project progress
- Project-level status, owner, fieldwork dates, sample, markets, current stage and next milestone

**Voice of Customer**
- Simplified qualitative approach: customer goals, pain points, decision triggers, journey moments, information sources and supplier-support expectations
- Persona-specific preference cards and Readiness × Friction map
- Persona × Theme coding matrix, theme / implication table, cross-customer patterns and verbatim evidence
- Risk assessment, Executive Recommendations and action roadmap

**Expert & KOL Interview Analysis**
- Theme heatmap, Readiness × Friction view, Expert Insight Feed, consensus / divergence table
- Expert mix, innovation outlook, evidence expectations, cross-project recurrence and strategic hypotheses
- Risk assessment, Executive Recommendations and validation roadmap

**Quantitative Survey Analysis**
- Filtered analytical base, sample mix, segment mix, Likert-style response distribution and outcome trend
- Importance × Performance, Readiness × Friction, Persona × Theme matrix
- Driver analysis, persona preference deltas, open-text coding and statistical detail
- Persona-specific preferences, risk assessment, Executive Recommendations and roadmap

All respondent-level findings remain explicitly synthetic demo data.


## Navigation update — Executive Hub, Industry Overview & Knowledge Repository

The platform navigation now separates the executive landing experience from the detailed industry dashboard:

- **Executive Hub** is the landing page and daily decision center. It combines immediate-attention signals, active PMR action items, industry trends and dynamics, macro factors, regional buzz, customer signals, recent public intelligence and a contextual executive assistant.
- **Industry Overview** is the renamed former Executive Hub industry page. It retains market size, growth, regional opportunity, segment mix, key players, competitive structure, ecosystem, drivers, risks, trends and strategic opportunities.
- **Knowledge Repository** is now a dedicated document and evidence hub with domain-specific internal assets, direct source links, local upload UI and prototype connectors for OneDrive, Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage, Contify, Sprinklr, PubMed, Google Scholar, PharmaTell and AlphaSense.

### Executive intelligence assistant
The Executive Hub assistant allows the user to select team, information need and region before asking a business question. In the static GitHub Pages prototype it synthesizes source-linked public intelligence already ingested into MedTech 360 with the synthetic PMR dataset. Live internet retrieval and live enterprise-source ingestion require secured backend search, OAuth and AI connectors.

### Knowledge Repository prototype behavior
Local file selection is browser-session only in the static frontend. Connector buttons demonstrate the target experience and do not authenticate to third-party systems until production APIs / enterprise connectors are wired.
